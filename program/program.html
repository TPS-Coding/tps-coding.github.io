        <h1>Program Info</h1>
        <p>Children will start by mastering essential coding concepts, 
            from data types to algorithms, before bringing their ideas to
             life with interactive programs like Mad Libs, Hangman, 
             and number-guessing games. Then, they can level up their 
             skills as they explore game design, learning how to create custom 
             sprites, animate characters, and build real-world physics into 
             their own 2D games.</p>
