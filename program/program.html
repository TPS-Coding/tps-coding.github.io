                <p>The new computer science program at Tuxedo Park School is 
                leveling up the game in middle school.<br> The program is 
                designed to develop students' skills in problem-solving, analysis,<br>
                and mathematics through fun, 2D game development.

        <h1>Program Info</h1>
        <p>Children will start by mastering essential coding concepts, 
            from data types to algorithms, before bringing their ideas to
             life with interactive programs like Mad Libs, Hangman, 
             and number-guessing games. Then, they can level up their 
             skills as they explore game design, learning how to create custom 
             sprites, animate characters, and build real-world physics into 
             their own 2D games.<br></p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <p class="sixth">
            The program starts in 6th grade, with Intro Python Programming, where students are introduced to 
        computers and using the Linux command line. The terminal is one of 
        the most powerful tools you can learn in computing. We proceed by introducing
        them to the Python programming language through carefully curated Jupyter
        notebooks. We then jump right into 2D-game development using Python and the Pygame 
        library. <br>
        <br>The children code line for line with the instructor. The concepts
        are always explained in pseudo code beforehand and during a Q&A session at 
        the beginning of class. During the 40min class, we may write anywhere from 5 to 
        20 lines of code. It is a slow process, with the kids learning that they have
        to be very precise, dubugging along the way. As we progress, they learn how to
        catch mistakes and fix them without instructor assistance. They gain familiarity
        with how to read code and are unafraid to make edits. <br>
        <br>
        Will your child be able
        to sit down at a blank screen and independently write a python program or 
        pass an interview at Google? No. But they will gain valuable skills like:
        focus, attention to detail, code recall and recognition, intro to important
        math concepts, self confidence, how to use the terminal, how to use a code editor,
        how to use the command line to run programs and applications, etc.,<br><br></p>
        <p class="seventh">
            In 7th-8th grade, students continue to use python and pygame in Python Programming 2, but write more
            complicated games.There is also more focus on core python concepts as well 
            as assigned homework on important CS algorithms. At the end of this class,
            students should be able to independently write python programs. <br>
            <br></p>
            <p class="eighth">
            (In Concept): In 8th-9th grade, in Programming 3 (prereqs: PP 1 & 2), students will learn C++ by
            re-coding all their previous games with Raylib.
             C++ remains highly relevant in 
            industries where performance and memory control are critical. Its 
            applications in finance (high-frequency trading), embedded systems, 
            game development, and automotive software make it a valuable skill.
            Major industries like gaming (with engines like Unity and Unreal Engine), 
            aerospace (spacecraft software), and financial tech (algorithmic 
            trading systems) rely on C++ for their development.<br>
            <br>
            (In Concept): In 9th grade, for advanced students, with schedule permitting and demand,
            there may be a Machine Learning elective offered.
